Dear {},

I am writing to you today because I am interested in applying for the position of {} as posted on {}. I have worked for years using just about every variant of SQL to query, store, and transform data. I have taught myself R, Python, and Ruby to perform a myriad of tasks including predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms, web scraping, data extraction, ETL processes, and ETL automation. Though my academic background may not appear to be in line with the job description, I assure you that my professional experience makes me an ideal candidate for this position and an asset to your team.

I have also become very interested in cluster environments and distributed computing. In an effort to better understand the Hadoop and Spark environments at my current position, I built a functioning Hadoop cluster from the ground up out of Raspberry Pis. The process was not simple and I learned from my mistakes and am all the much wiser for it.

One of my own personal goals, in any position at any company, is to build scalable workflows that can be easily automated. At the Boston Area Research Initiative, I built automated web scrapers to help shape policy decisions at a state level. At the City of Boston I engineered an email notification system using the G-Suite API and stable data extraction tools between Windows and Linux servers. At Boston Health Economics I contributed to an ongoing automation effort to simplify the ETL process across different data types and make the whole system more modular and, most importantly, easy to learn for new hires.

I could go on, but I feel an in person meeting would do more justice and allow me to learn more about {}, and the intricacies of the {} role. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
